## A Travel Journal with React Props

This is a travel journal web app built with React to showcase the value of props in creating interactive and dynamic user experiences. 

### Why Props Matter

React props enable you to pass data down the component hierarchy, making your code reusable, flexible, and easier to manage. This project demonstrates how props can be used to:

  * Populate journal entries with details like location, date, and photos.
  * Create a dynamic and visually appealing journal layout.


Note: This is a learning project and may not offer all features found in a full-fledged travel journal app.

### Technologies Used

  * Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript
  * Framework: Vite React ([vitejs.dev](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://vitejs.dev/))

### Setting Up

### Understanding Props

Explore the project code to see how props are used effectively:

  * Card component:** Receives props to display information like title, date, location, and photos for each travel entry.
  * Main app: Renders child components (entries and filters) and provides necessary data through props.
